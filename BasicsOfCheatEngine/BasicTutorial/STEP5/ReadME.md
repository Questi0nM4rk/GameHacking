# The fifth step

This step is finally somethig interesting. In this step, we gonna NOPE code out. NOPEing is a really easy yet powerfull thing.

Click new scan and change the value to 4-byte as this is the value of most things in games - *int*. Than scan for the value you have in the tutorial. Change value and next scan for it. Do it untill you found what youve been looking for. Add it to your table and RC on it. Select *what writes to this address*. It will attach a debuger to it. Now just press change walue in the tutorial. You will see a Assembly code pop up. RC on it and select *replace with code that does nothing* - NOPE. This will effectively just remove the code that did anything with the value. Now close it all and go change the value. It didnt change. Now go next.
