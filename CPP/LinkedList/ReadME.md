## Linked Lists: Overview

A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science that consists of a sequence of nodes. Each node contains two main components:
- Data: Holds the actual value or payload.
- Pointer/Reference: Points to the next node in the sequence.

Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation. They offer dynamic memory allocation, making them suitable for situations where the size of the data structure can change dynamically.

### Types of Linked Lists
- **Singly Linked List**: Each node points only to the next node.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both the next and the previous nodes.
- **Circular Linked List**: In a singly or doubly linked list, the last node's pointer points back to the first node, creating a circular structure.

## Applications of Linked Lists

Linked lists find various applications in computer science and software development:

### 1. Dynamic Data Storage
Linked lists are ideal for scenarios where the data size is uncertain or can change over time. Elements can be added or removed efficiently without reallocation of memory, making linked lists suitable for managing growing data sets.

### 2. Implementing Stacks and Queues
Linked lists can be used to implement stack and queue data structures. In a stack, the last element added is the first one to be removed (Last-In-First-Out, LIFO). In a queue, the first element added is the first one to be removed (First-In-First-Out, FIFO).

### 3. Memory Allocation
Dynamic memory allocation and management often use linked lists. Operating systems use linked lists to keep track of free memory blocks and manage memory allocation for processes.

### 4. Music and Video Playlists
Media players often use linked lists to manage playlists. Each node in the list represents a song or video, and the linked structure allows easy reordering and manipulation of the playlist.

### 5. Hash Tables and Collision Handling
In hash table implementations, linked lists can be used to handle collisions when multiple keys map to the same hash value. The linked list stores elements that share the same hash value.

### 6. Polynomial Representation in Mathematics
Linked lists can represent polynomials in mathematics efficiently. Each node represents a term in the polynomial, and the linked structure simplifies operations like addition and multiplication.

### 7. Symbol Tables and Compiler Design
Symbol tables in compilers and interpreters can be implemented using linked lists. Each node contains information about identifiers in a program, such as variables, functions, or classes.

Linked lists provide flexibility and efficiency in these and many other scenarios. However, they may have slightly higher memory overhead due to the need for storing pointers/references alongside the data. The choice of using a linked list depends on the specific requirements of the application.
