# Game Hacking Path

Welcome to my Game Hacking journey! In this repository, I'll be documenting my progress as I delve into the fascinating world of game hacking. While I'm new to this field, I'm excited to learn and share my experiences with you.

## Purpose of this repo

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal log where I record my exploration, experiments, and discoveries related to game hacking. I aim to understand the techniques and tools used in game hacking, and I will document my findings in a way that's easy to understand for both beginners and those with some knowledge in the field.

## Purpuse of this path

I have chosen this path to delve into the realm of hacking. While I have been involved in conventional hacking for some time, its practical applications are limited in real-life scenarios. Consequently, I have transitioned towards a closely related field that provides greater flexibility and usability. This new domain shares numerous similarities with traditional hacking, encompassing techniques such as evasions, memory manipulation, reverse engineering, and injections, among others. It offers the advantage of being accessible whenever desired, allowing me to explore its potential at my convenience. By simply downloading any game, I can experiment with it in the safety of my home on my personal computer. And the most significant consequence would be a BAN.

### Addition

You may believe that conventional hacking is easily accessible. However, the true accessibility, irrespective of time and place of normal hacking lies in specific challenges, CTFs, VMs, etc... Nonetheless, these platforms are designed with pre-existing vulnerabilities for participants to discover. My aspiration, on the other hand, was to engage in genuine hacking. A captivating journey where I uncover the inadvertent mistakes of others, rather than those intentionally planted for educational purposes. Also I am gonna continue with normal hacking, just want kids to cry when I kill them in God mode.

## Approach

I'll be taking a hands-on approach to game hacking, using a combination of reverse engineering, memory analysis, and scripting. I'll explore various game hacking techniques, such as finding and modifying memory addresses, hooking functions, creating trainers, and more.
